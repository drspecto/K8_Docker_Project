## Disclaimer

This is not a web development project â€” it's a **DevOps-focused project**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and container orchestration. I built a simple full-stack URL shortener only to show how I can:

- Dockerize both frontend and backend applications
- Create and manage multiple Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, LoadBalancers)
- Deploy applications on **Minikube** and **EKS**
- Handle container-to-container communication effectively

This project is **not** about frontend or backend design â€” it's purely for showcasing my **DevOps expertise**.
